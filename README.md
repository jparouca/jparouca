### About Me

I'm **tak**, most commonly known as Takaxo on the world wide web. I am a professional web developer. Currently pursuing to finish my degree in Computer Science.

My freetime mostly goes towards working on occasional open source projects to enhance wayland user experience and bridge the gap between X11. Ever since my introduction to the world
of FOSS and Linux in late 2020, I have been very passionate about writing my own software. While I avoid publishing them to GitHub,
writing home-made CLI applications are one of my favorite past-time activities. I also do webdev (matter of fact I'm in the process of developing my first MVP)

My experience and knowledge (both in heavy quotes) spans over multiple languages, my primary
focus is backend applications in Node and Go. I also falled to the rabbit hole of linux desktop development which doesn't have many non-janky options (looking at you Electron) but I found GTK and its javascript keybinds to be good.

- 📅 Programming since 2018
- 🖥️ Arch / Hyprland / Neovim
- 👨 Despite its shortcomings, Go is my _go-to_ language (pun fully intended)
- 🌐 Frontend via React/NextJS used to be my primary stack. Now I focus more on backend applications.
- ❄️Arch remains my favorite Linux distro for both personal while Debian for enterprise use (I manage my small fleet of servers for factorio and zomboid powered by it)

- 🎲 Fun fact: I have entered the world of programming misadventure involving assembly injections for transformice hacks back in 2011
